# Welcome to Adwenesa - An LLM-Client Application

Welcome to the YambaCode LLM-Client, otherwise known as **Adwenesa**!

This prototype is part of the YambaCode **"Adwene Bone"** project series.

**Adwenesa** serves as a client for interacting with language models in a structured and efficient way. This project is designed as a Proof of Concept (POC) and aims to be simple and explorative in nature.

*(Note: The project name "Adwene Bone" is Akan for "Artificial Intelligence")*

## Overview
Adwenesa is an LLM (Large Language Model) client application that allows seamless interaction with an LLM server, making it a versatile tool for conversational AI projects.

### LLM Studio
This project is intended to connect with **LLM Studio**, an open-source language model project. You can learn more about LLM Studio, including installation and configuration, by visiting the official [LLM Studio GitHub repository](https://github.com/llm-studio/llm-studio) for further details.

## Getting Started
### Configuration
Ensure the configuration details meet your requirements:
- **Server Port**: Update the server port in the `application.yaml` to match your environment.

### Swagger Documentation
- **Swagger Version**: View API documentation at [Swagger Docs](http://localhost:3141/v3/api-docs)
- **Swagger UI**: Access the interactive UI at [Swagger UI](http://localhost:3141/swagger-ui/index.html)

### Actuator Endpoints
For metadata and application status verification:
- **Application Health**: [Health Endpoint](http://localhost:3141/actuator/health)
- **Application Info**: [Info Endpoint](http://localhost:3141/actuator/info)

Ensure that the correct port (`3141` by default) is set in `application.yaml`.

## Part of the Adwene Bone Projects
Adwenesa is one of the prototypes under the **Adwene Bone** umbrella. The focus of these projects is to explore the potential of **artificial intelligence** by creating tools and applications that contribute to the development of intelligent systems.
